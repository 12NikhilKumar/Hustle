			<p>Hand soaps: we use them every day, multiple times, and they leave us feeling so soft and clean. And honestly, they smell amazing, so there’s no shame in stocking up on your favorites or discovering new ones.</p>

			<p>Our <a href="/c/hand-soaps-sanitizers/foaming-hand-soap">foaming hand soaps</a> are on everyone’s list. Super-luxe cloud of gentle cleanser? Check. Soothing aloe, natural essential oils, moisturizing shea extract and nourishing vitamin E? You got it. Available in every scent imaginable from fruity to exotic? Yep. Plus, the chic, colorful bottles look amazing on any sink. (Traditional hand soaps are just as effective as anti-bacterial soaps when you wash for 20 seconds*.)</p>

			<p>But what if your hands are <i>too dry?</i> Grab a bottle of <a href="/c/hand-soaps-sanitizers/nourishing-hand-soap">nourishing hand soap</a>. You might need some extra moisture and this creamy, silky formula is packed full of skin-loving ingredients, like essential oils and vitamin E, to condition your hands every wash. And introducing out latest addition to the hand soaps family: <a href="/c/hand-soaps-sanitizers/gel-hand-soaps">gentle gel hand soaps</a>. They're made without dyes or parabens, but are full of the fragrance you love and the ingredients you need to maintain your skin's natural moisture barrier.</p>

			<p>Don’t forget to decorate with a soap holder! Whether it’s a piece that matches your décor or adds a pop of glam to your sink counter, you’ll definitely find your perfect match. </p>

			<p>P.S. Soap is a great way to keep germs away, but what if you’re on the go? Grab one of our <a href="/c/hand-soaps-sanitizers/all-hand-sanitizers">PocketBac hand sanitizers</a>! Enriched with shea extract, vitamin E, 71% alcohol and aloe, Bath &amp; Body Works hand sanitizers kill 99.9% of most common germs and keep your hands clean and soft.

			<p>*According to FDA: There is currently no evidence that anti-bacterial soaps are any more effective at preventing illness than normal soap and water. See more at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19">FDA.gov</a>.</p>
